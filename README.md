===================

English Dictionaries Project (AOO+Mozilla+others)

For many years that some people stopped developing dictionaries for open-source software.

It would be great if we could continue the work of these persons and improve the already existing dictionaries.

The biggest issue is that most of the dictionaries are obfuscated and the original developers are no longer available to provide the clean text ones.

So, in some cases we will have to start from zero.

A hard task but an important one for current and future generations.

I am only improving the en_GB... en_US and en_CA are improved by Kevin Atkinson with whom I am in contact... but people can report issues in my GitHub and I will inform Kevin in his repository.

Please notice the "en_GB_speller_for_Mozilla+AOO+LO_2013+.txt" where I keep a log of all the changes.

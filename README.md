English Dictionaries Project (AOO+Mozilla+others)

For many years people stopped maintaining dictionaries for open-source software.

It would be great if we could continue their work and improve the already existing dictionaries or create new ones.

The biggest issue is that most of these dictionaries are obfuscated (codified in a way that only certain software packages can have access to the wordlists) and the original developers are no longer available to provide the clean text ones.

In some cases we will have to start from a long time gone position, which is the last known clean text version of the dictionary.

Modifying, updating and maintaining a dictionary is a hard task but an important one for current and future generations.

The initial idea was that other projects could also use this GitHub entry and take the .AFF and .DIC files and use them in projects which use proofing -or spellchecking- functionalities.


I (Marco Pinto) am only improving the en_GB. The en_US and en_CA are maintained by Kevin Atkinson.
Please contact Kevin directly for the latter two:
see http://wordlist.aspell.net 
and https://sourceforge.net/projects/wordlist/files/Hunspell

I will release a monthly en_GB update for Mozilla. For OpenOffice it may take longer because there are 10'000s of people downloading and I don't want to overload the servers.

Please notice the "en_GB_speller_for_Mozilla+AOO+LO_2013+.txt" above where I keep a log of all the changes.

I always keep a note of the most recent version released for Mozilla, AOO and LO on the official Proofing Tool GUI site:

#### Each GitHub folder has:
* .AFF + .DIC + README + WORDLIST.  
  
  
#### Licences for the wordlists:
* en_CA (Kevin Atkinson) - BSD/MIT-Like;
* en_GB (Marco A.G.Pinto) - LGPL;
* en_US (Kevin Atkinson) - BSD/MIT-Like.  
  
  

#### Suggesting words:

(First check the wordlist .txt file inside the folder of the latest en_GB. If the words aren't there, check "en_GB_speller_for_Mozilla+AOO+LO_2013+.txt" at the top of this page).  
If <B>NOT</B> found:
* Open a case or e-mail Marco Pinto with the suggested words.

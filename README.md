English Dictionaries Project (AOO+Mozilla+others)

For many years that some people stopped developing dictionaries for open-source software.

It would be great if we could continue their work and improve the already existing dictionaries.

The biggest issue is that most of the dictionaries are obfuscated and the original developers are no longer available to provide the clean text ones.

So, in some cases we will have to start from a low position, which is the last clean version of the dictionaries.

This is a hard task but an important one for current and future generations.

The idea was that other projects could also use this GitHub and take the .AFF and .DIC and use them in projects which use spell checking.

I am only improving the en_GB... en_US and en_CA are maintained by Kevin Atkinson and, for those two, please contact Kevin directly:
http://wordlist.aspell.net AND https://sourceforge.net/projects/wordlist/files/Hunspell

Every month I will release an en_GB update for Mozilla and for OpenOffice it will take longer because there are 10 000s of people downloading and I don't want to overload the servers.

Please notice the "en_GB_speller_for_Mozilla+AOO+LO_2013+.txt" above where I keep a log of all the changes.

I always keep a note of the most recent version released for Mozilla and AOO on the official Proofing Tool GUI site:
